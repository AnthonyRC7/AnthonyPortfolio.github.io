								<h3>Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, and Analyzing Space X Data</h3>
								<p>In this project, I collected SpaceX data through web scraping and the SpaceX REST API, meticulously wrangled and cleaned the dataset, 
									conducted exploratory data analysis with SQL and data visualization, created interactive maps with Folium, and developed an Interactive 
									SpaceX Launch Records Dashboard. The project's culmination involved building a predictive model using classification algorithms to forecast 
									the success or failure of future Falcon 9 first stage landings, considering factors like weather conditions and mission details.</p>

								<h3>Analyzing Covid World Data Using SQL</h3>
								<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact worldwide, and data analysis has played a crucial role in understanding its spread and impact. 
									In this project, I delved into Covid-19 world data using SQLite. I collected, cleaned, and analyzed data related to the pandemic's progression, 
									infection rates, and other relevant metrics. By employing SQLite for data manipulation and visualization, I aimed to offer a comprehensive view
									of the pandemic's dynamics, helping stakeholders, healthcare professionals, and researchers make informed decisions.</p>

								<h3>Data Visualization and Geospatial Analysis with Python</h3>
								<p>In this multi-faceted project, I combine two datasets to create compelling visualizations. Firstly, I continue my exploration of immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013. 
									Additionally, I delve into San Francisco Police Department Incidents data for the year 2016. Using maps and geospatial techniques, I showcase immigration patterns 
									and incidents distribution across San Francisco, providing valuable insights for both datasets.</p>

								<h3>Data Visualization and Geospatial Analysis with Tableau and Power BI</h3>
								<p>I used data visualization tools to analyze and present insights in diverse projects. With Tableau, I explored Airbnb data, revealing pricing trends and property insights. 
									In another Tableau project, I delved into the gaming industry's sales data. Additionally, using Power BI, I studied data professionals' demographics and preferences 
									and delved into post-apocalyptic supply chains, identifying vulnerabilities and strategies.</p>

								<h3>Machine Learning Projects with Python</h3>
								<p>Throughout this journey, I harness the power of Python and machine learning to unlock insights, make data-driven decisions, and address diverse challenges across industries, 
									from automotive and telecommunications to healthcare and finance. These stages collectively illustrate the versatility and impact of machine learning in today's data-driven world.</p>

								<h3>Data Cleaning, and Analyzing an Automobile Dataset Using Python</h3>
								<p>In this project, I began by collecting and preprocessing a comprehensive automobile dataset. I then conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and correlations. 
									Next, I developed predictive models for estimating car prices, fine-tuning them for accuracy. Finally, I rigorously evaluated and refined these models to ensure optimal performance.</p>
